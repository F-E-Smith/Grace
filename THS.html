					<h1>The Higher Self</h1>
					<p>
						QHHT and Aura Hypnosis are techniques used to help facilitie a
						connection with your higher self. I speak to your higher self,
						though you, as if you were speaking. Your higher self is the
						blueprint to your soul. Your higher self has the key to your past
						for as far back as the universe was created. Every lifetime you’ve
						experienced, your higher self has experienced as well.

						says: "Through spiritual exposure, a person is thought to make a
						conscious connection with their higher self or other higher beings.
						In this state, the meditator may tap into this higher intelligence
						in order to develop a more enlightened perspective on world
						matters.".
