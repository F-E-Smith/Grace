			<h1>My connection to Nefertiti</h1>
			<p>
				During a hypnosis session with my friend Wendie, I discovered I had a past life as Queen Nefertiti. Wendie had a past life with Nefertiti and she wanted to heal Nefertiti. So Wendie went under hypnosis to do this. There was trauma in Nefertiti's death and an aspect of her needed to go to the light to be healed. So we called in the archangels to do this. When Nefertiti came back from being healed she revealed that she was an aspect of me. During another hypnosis session with Wendie, I asked how I got this big birthmark on my stomach. Wendie's higher self told me it was from a sword. You were killed. You were Nefertiti. The pain in your back stems from that as well. The aspect of Nefertiti is healed and with you now she said. The pain in your back will be less or none at all. When we have pieces of us missing we can have pain and aches in that area.

				So quite literally, we break a piece of our soul off and leave it behind to maybe come back and collect it later. She said you collected that now. So as she integrates into you more and more, you have less back pain. I asked why did I choose to have this birthmark on me. I was told to remind me of my life as Nefertiti. You wanted to make sure you did not forget to come back and get her. This was insurance of that.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was able to talk to the Nefertiti aspect through Wendie and find out that she was a snake charmer and loved that. She had a big black snake named Zora. She liked to pamper herself with milk baths, oils, and lotions. She said she was a great ruler. And was very good at Magic and energy work. Her family was hybrids from an alien race. She was half human. The skulls were elongated but like babies. they were wrapped so that they were more elongated. Like their ancestors. She was 28 when she died. I asked her why she was killed, she said power and control. When you play games as I play, those are the other players. That's the things they are willing to do to take your power. It wasn't for the faint of heart.
